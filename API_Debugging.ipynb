    "This workbook has been prepared to document the process of writing the scripts used to retrieve my desired data from the NHL's public API.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each player on the NHL site is assigned a 7-digit ID number, which is needed to access their statistics using with API requests.  I was able to retrieve an up-to-date list of player ID numbers from https://hockey-statistics.com/.  From there, I was able to create a list of all active and inactive players that played in the NHL in the last ~3 decades.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When making my API calls, information was pulled from two endpoints:  `people` and `stats`.  The `people` endpoint contains player bio information, such as first name, last name, weight, height, date of birth, position played, and so on.  The `stats` endpoint, and more particularly the `stats=yearByYear` endpoint, contains season-by-season statistics for each season that a player played in the NHL.  Statistics include features such as number of games played, team played for, number of goals/assists/points scored, average ice time, shots, and so on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The working piece of code that I deployed first calls the `people` endpoint to retrieve player bio information, then calls the `stats` endpoint to retrieve player statistics, which are immediately converted into a pandas DataFrame.  Next, specific attributes of interest from the `people` endpoint are added to the statistics DataFrame.  A for loop was used to iterate over the entire process, so that I could collect data for all of the player IDs of interest.  Now that the architecture for the data collection is in place, I could go farther back into the 80s if I wanted to increase the size of my training dataset.  That is a decision I will make once the dataset has been partially-cleaned.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I have tried to document below is the process of familiarizing myself with the API call process, and piecewise testing of my code, building up to the final code block that is being actively deployed for data collection.  Where bugs have been encountered, I have documented the process of resolving them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to give credit to Nick Paul's personal blog (https://www.nickpaul.info/), as his clear documentation of his personal experience accessing the NHL API was an immense help to my efforts. "
